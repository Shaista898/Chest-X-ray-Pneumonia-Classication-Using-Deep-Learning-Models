# Chest-X-ray-Pneumonia-Classication-Using-Deep-Learning-Models
Pneumonia detection from kaggle chest X-rays using deep learning. Compared CNN, ResNet50, and CNN+Transformer models with augmentation, class balancing, and regularization. CNN+Transformer achieved best accuracy by combining local features with global attention.
